# Playlist Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive playlist management system for the Go Radio admin panel that allows administrators to view all playlists in the database and switch the active playlist seamlessly.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Radio Service Enhancements
**File:** `internal/services/radio_service.go`

- **New Method**: `SetActivePlaylist(playlistID string) error`
  - Validates playlist existence and content
  - Creates new playback state with the selected playlist
  - Starts playback from the first song of the new playlist
  - Broadcasts playlist change events via EventBus
  - Thread-safe implementation with proper mutex handling

- **Interface Update**: Added `GetByID(playlistID string) (*models.Playlist, error)` to `PlaylistRepositoryInterface`

### 2. API Endpoints
**File:** `internal/controllers/radio_controller.go`

- **New Admin Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/admin/playlist/set-active`
  - Protected with JWT authentication middleware
  - Accepts JSON payload: `{"playlist_id": "uuid"}`
  - Returns success response with playlist change confirmation
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 3. Database Enhancements
**File:** `internal/repositories/playlist_repository.go`

- **Enhanced GetAll()**: Updated to include song count using SQL JOIN
  - Uses `LEFT JOIN` with `playlist_songs` table
  - Returns `song_count` metadata for each playlist
  - Maintains performance with grouped queries

**File:** `internal/models/song.go`

- **Updated Playlist Model**: Added `SongCount` field
  - `SongCount int json:"song_count,omitempty" db:"-"`
  - Computed field, not stored in database

### 4. WebSocket Integration
**File:** `internal/websocket/handler.go`

- **Event Handling**: Existing `playback_control` event handler processes `playlist_change` actions
- **Real-time Updates**: All connected clients receive playlist change notifications
- **State Synchronization**: Ensures all clients switch to the new playlist simultaneously

### 5. Event Broadcasting
**File:** `internal/events/event_bus.go`

- **Playlist Change Events**: Uses existing `PlaybackControlEvent` structure
- **Event Flow**: Service → EventBus → WebSocket → All Clients
- **Actions Supported**: `playlist_change`, `play`, `pause`, `skip`, `previous`

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Admin Page Enhancement
**File:** `client/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx`

- **New Section**: `[PLAYLIST_MANAGEMENT]` with comprehensive table interface
- **Features**:
  - Displays all playlists with metadata (name, description, song count, creation date)
  - Shows current active playlist with visual indicators
  - One-click playlist switching with loading states
  - Responsive table design with hover effects
  - Error handling and loading states

### 2. API Integration
- **Query**: Fetches all playlists with React Query
- **Mutation**: Handles playlist switching with optimistic updates
- **Cache Management**: Invalidates related queries after playlist changes

### 3. UI/UX Features
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Green highlight for active playlist row
  - "ACTIVE" badge in playlist name
  - Status column showing ACTIVE/INACTIVE
- **Responsive Design**: Table adapts to different screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and loading states
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback for user actions

### 4. Real-time Updates
**File:** `client/src/contexts/RadioContext.tsx`

- **WebSocket Handling**: Added `playlist_change` event processing
- **State Management**: Updates queue information when playlist changes
- **Audio Synchronization**: Automatically handles audio playback for new playlist

## API Endpoints Summary

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/playlists` - Get all playlists (with song counts)
- `GET /api/v1/playlists/{id}` - Get specific playlist
- `GET /api/v1/playlists/{id}/songs` - Get playlist songs

### Admin Endpoints (JWT Protected)
- `POST /api/v1/admin/playlist/set-active` - Set active playlist
- `POST /api/v1/admin/play` - Start/resume playback
- `POST /api/v1/admin/pause` - Pause playback
- `POST /api/v1/admin/skip` - Skip to next song
- `POST /api/v1/admin/previous` - Go to previous song

## Database Schema
```sql
-- Playlists table (existing)
CREATE TABLE playlists (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- Playlist songs junction table (existing)
CREATE TABLE playlist_songs (
    playlist_id UUID REFERENCES playlists(id),
    youtube_id TEXT REFERENCES songs(youtube_id),
    position INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

## WebSocket Events

### Outgoing Events (Server → Client)
```json
{
  "type": "playback_control",
  "payload": {
    "action": "playlist_change",
    "song": { /* first song of new playlist */ },
    "state": { /* complete playback state */ },
    "timestamp": 1672531200000
  }
}
```

### Event Flow
1. Admin clicks "ACTIVATE" button in playlist table
2. Frontend sends POST to `/api/v1/admin/playlist/set-active`
3. RadioService switches playlist and broadcasts event
4. All WebSocket clients receive `playlist_change` event
5. Clients update UI and restart audio with new playlist

## Testing

### Backend Tests
- **TestSetActivePlaylist**: Comprehensive test coverage for playlist switching
- **Updated TestSkip**: Fixed to work with playlist-based architecture
- **All Tests Pass**: 100% test success rate maintained

### Test Scenarios Covered
- Switching to valid playlist
- Handling non-existent playlists
- Empty playlist error handling
- Concurrent access safety
- Event broadcasting verification

## Security
- **JWT Authentication**: All admin endpoints protected
- **Input Validation**: Playlist ID validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without data leakage
- **Authorization**: Only authenticated admins can change playlists

## Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Queries**: Single JOIN query for playlist metadata
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections properly managed
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of WebSocket connections
- **Caching**: Frontend query caching with strategic invalidation

## User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time UI updates across all clients
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of active playlist
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with helpful messages
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators during operations
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements
- Playlist creation/editing directly from admin panel
- Drag-and-drop song reordering within playlists
- Playlist import/export functionality
- Advanced filtering and search for large playlist collections
- Playlist scheduling and automation features

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Fixed type inconsistencies between frontend and backend
- Improved test coverage for playlist operations
- Enhanced error handling across the application
- Standardized event naming conventions

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly playlist management system that integrates seamlessly with the existing Go Radio architecture while maintaining high performance and excellent user experience.
